 I've created the project with Starter Files of UE5 and developed a short loop which you're firing limited amound of balls to the barrels and when your balls are out. The game restarts itself in given seconds.
 
 What I've Learned from this game: 

 -Blueprint Basics: Nodes, Pins

 -Unreal Basics: Maps, Actors, Components, Transforms, Vectors

 -How Work OOP Basics with Blueprints: Objects/Structs, Classes, Member Functions, Variables, Strings, References, Functions
 
 
  # Second Game: Island Jumper

This was my first C++ project. I've created my own classes and bluprints via scripting in Editor (Visual Studio Code). It was not an easy task to prepare the coding enviroment to start build the game with C++ and blueprints. I've created mover and rotator classes to made my parkour obstacles and blueprints from them. I've also did a level design to make the parkour game fun.

 What I've Learned from this game:

 -C++ Programming with Unreal: How to create C++ Structures, Classes in UE
 
 -Blueprint and C++ Integration: Blueprint Child Classes of C++
 
 -Unreal Types: FVector, FRotator, UPROPERTYâ€¦
 
 -GameMode and Character Classes
 
 # Third Game: Mystic Dungeon
 
 Again it's a C++ project but this time the classes and codes are more complicated. I also used lumen (lightning tool in UE5) and level design tools built in UE5. I designed 2 levels but then channged my opinion and only made 1 level which was enough for prototyping. It's high graphical and atmospheric, first-person exploration, puzzle-game.

What I've Learned from this game:

-Pointers and References

-Actor Components and Scene Components

-Including Header Files

-Lighting with Lumen

-Modular Level Design

-Line Tracing and Collisions

-Calling C++ Functions from Blueprint
