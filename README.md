 I've created the project with Starter Files of UE5 and developed a short loop which you're firing limited amound of balls to the barrels and when your balls are out. The game restarts itself in given seconds.
 
 What I've Learned from this game: 

 -Blueprint Basics: Nodes, Pins

 -Unreal Basics: Maps, Actors, Components, Transforms, Vectors

 -How Work OOP Basics with Blueprints: Objects/Structs, Classes, Member Functions, Variables, Strings, References, Functions

This was my first C++ project. I've created my own classes and bluprints via scripting in Editor (Visual Studio Code). It was not an easy task to prepare the coding enviroment to start build the game with C++ and blueprints. I've created mover and rotator classes to made my parkour obstacles and blueprints from them. I've also did a level design to make the parkour game fun.

 What I've Learned from this game:

 -C++ Programming with Unreal: How to create C++ Structures, Classes in UE
 -Blueprint and C++ Integration: Blueprint Child Classes of C++
 -Unreal Types: FVector, FRotator, UPROPERTYâ€¦
 -GameMode and Character Classes
