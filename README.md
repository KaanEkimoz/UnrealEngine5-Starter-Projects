 I've created the project with Starter Files of UE5 and developed a short loop which you're firing limited amound of balls to the barrels and when your balls are out. The game restarts itself in given seconds.
 
 What I've Learned from this game: 

 Blueprint Basics: Nodes, Pins

 Unreal Basics: Maps, Actors, Components, Transforms, Vectors

How Work OOP Basics with Blueprints: Objects/Structs, Classes, Member Functions, Variables, Strings, References, Functions
